# AIChemist Codex Porting Strategy

## Overall Approach

The migration from the original `backend/` structure to the new
`src/the_aichemist_codex/backend/` structure will follow these key principles:

1. **Evaluation before implementation**: Evaluate existing code in both
   locations before deciding what to port
2. **Quality over mechanical migration**: Choose the better implementation when
   duplicates exist
3. **Incremental porting**: Complete one module at a time to maintain a working
   system
4. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure API compatibility where possible

## Evaluation Process for Each Module

Before porting any module, perform these steps:

1. **Check for existing implementation** in the destination location
2. **If implementation exists in both locations**:

   - Compare code quality, readability, and maintainability
   - Evaluate performance characteristics for critical paths
   - Review error handling and edge case coverage
   - Assess documentation quality and test coverage
   - Determine which implementation better follows modern Python practices
   - Choose the superior implementation to keep or merge features if needed

3. **If no implementation exists in destination**:

   - Review original code for potential improvements
   - Port with enhancements where appropriate

4. **Document decisions** made during evaluation, especially if significant
   changes are made

## Remaining Modules to Port

Based on our inventory analysis, these modules need porting or verification:

### High Priority

1. **Search Module**:

   - Search engine implementation
   - Search providers (text, regex, vector)
   - Search utilities

2. **File Reader**:
   - Core file reading functionality
   - Format-specific readers

### Medium Priority

3. **Metadata Management**:

   - Metadata storage
   - Metadata extraction
   - Metadata querying

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Configuration sources
   - Configuration access
   - Configuration persistence

### Lower Priority

5. **Tools**:
   - Diagnostic tools
   - Development tools
   - Maintenance tools
