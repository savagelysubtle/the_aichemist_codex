### Usage

Add this to the beginning of your script:

```powershell
# Import logging utility
$utilityPath = Join-Path -Path $PSScriptRoot -ChildPath "../Utilities/Write-BIGLog.ps1"
. $utilityPath

# Start logging
$logFile = Start-BIGLogging -ScriptName $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path

# Log section header
Write-BIGHeader -Title "MY SCRIPT SECTION" -LogFile $logFile

# Log information
Write-BIGLog -Message "Processing started" -Level "INFO" -LogFile $logFile
Write-BIGLog -Message "This is a warning" -Level "WARNING" -LogFile $logFile
Write-BIGLog -Message "An error occurred" -Level "ERROR" -LogFile $logFile
Write-BIGLog -Message "Operation successful" -Level "SUCCESS" -LogFile $logFile

# End logging with duration
$startTime = Get-Date
# ... script operations ...
$duration = (Get-Date) - $startTime
Stop-BIGLogging -ScriptName $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path -LogFile $logFile -Duration $duration
```

### Log Levels

The logging utility supports the following log levels:

| Level   | Color  | Purpose                            |
| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| INFO    | White  | General information                |
| WARNING | Yellow | Warnings that don't stop execution |
| ERROR   | Red    | Errors that might stop execution   |
| DEBUG   | Cyan   | Detailed debugging information     |
| SUCCESS | Green  | Successful operations              |

### Log File Location

By default, logs are stored in the `scripts/logs` directory with the filename format `BIG-Memory-YYYY-MM-DD.log`. You can specify a custom log file path if needed.

## Adding New Utilities

When creating new utility scripts:

1. Follow the naming convention `Verb-BIGNoun.ps1`
2. Include a header comment with description, version, and creation date
3. Document parameters and usage
4. Export functions using `Export-ModuleMember` if needed
5. Update this README with the new utility details
