  This rule governs how active memory files are managed within the BIG BRAIN memory system.
  Active memory represents the current working context and is the most frequently accessed memory type.
</context>

<requirements>
  <requirement>Maintain all active memory files with current, accurate information</requirement>

  <requirement>Ensure consistent formatting and organization across active files</requirement>
  <requirement>Preserve important active file content during the Bedtime Protocol</requirement>
</requirements>

<rule>
## Active Memory Management Protocol

1. Active Memory Files:
   - projectbrief.md: Project foundation and requirements
   - productContext.md: Business and user perspective
   - activeContext.md: Current work focus and state
   - systemPatterns.md: Technical architecture patterns
   - techContext.md: Technology stack and environment
   - progress.md: Project status and roadmap
   - tasks.md: Task tracking and assignments
   - projectRules.md: Project-specific patterns and rules

2. Active Memory Operations:
   - Begin each significant task by reviewing all active memory files
   - Update activeContext.md at the start of each new work session
   - Add new technical patterns to systemPatterns.md as they emerge
   - Update progress.md when features are completed or milestones reached
   - Maintain tasks.md as the single source of truth for task tracking

3. Active Memory Maintenance:
   - Keep active memory files concise and focused on current information
   - Remove outdated information by moving it to appropriate long-term storage
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each active file
   - Verify active memory integrity after significant updates

  <requirement>Implement proper versioning for files moved to short-term memory</requirement>
  <requirement>Periodically review short-term memory for archival to long-term memory</requirement>
</requirements>

<rule>
## Short-term Memory Management Protocol

1. Short-term Memory Purpose:
   - Store previous versions of active files (1-2 sessions old)
   - Maintain temporary information pending categorization
   - Hold recent session summaries before permanent archival

2. Versioning Protocol:
   - When an active file is significantly modified, move the previous version to short-term memory
   - Use date-based versioning: filename_YYYY-MM-DD.md
   - Maintain a maximum of 3 versions of each file in short-term memory

3. Short-term to Long-term Transition:
   - Review short-term memory files after 3 sessions
   - Consolidate important information to appropriate long-term memory locations
   - Archive complete session summaries to episodic memory

  <requirement>Maintain consistent organization within each memory type</requirement>
  <requirement>Implement proper cross-referencing between related memory items</requirement>
</requirements>

<rule>
## Long-term Memory Management Protocol

1. Long-term Memory Categories:
   - Episodic Memory (experience-based):
     * sessions/: Session summaries and experiences
     * milestones/: Project milestone records
     * decisions/: Decision records and justifications

   - Semantic Memory (knowledge-based):
     * domain/: Domain concepts and terminology
     * apis/: API documentation and usage patterns
     * features/: Feature specifications and requirements

   - Procedural Memory (action-based):
     * workflows/: Development and operational processes
     * guides/: How-to guides and tutorials
     * checklists/: Operational procedures and checklists

   - Creative Memory (design outputs):
     * architecture/: System architecture designs
     * components/: Component designs and patterns
     * algorithms/: Algorithm designs and implementations
     * data-models/: Data structure designs

2. Long-term Memory Operations:
   - Add information to long-term memory only after verification
   - Categorize information based on content type, not source
   - Maintain consistent file organization within each memory type
   - Create cross-references between related memory items

3. Memory Retrieval Protocol:
   - Access episodic memory for historical context and decisions
   - Use semantic memory for domain knowledge and feature information
   - Reference procedural memory for "how-to" guidance
   - Leverage creative memory for design patterns and solutions

<version>1.0.0</version>

<context>
  The Bedtime Protocol is a critical workflow that ensures proper memory preservation between sessions.
  It must be executed completely before ending any significant work session.
</context>

<requirements>
  <requirement>Update all core memory files with latest information</requirement>
  <requirement>Create session summary in activeContext.md</requirement>
  <requirement>Archive important information to appropriate memory types</requirement>
  <requirement>Verify memory consistency across all files</requirement>
</requirements>

<rule>
## Bedtime Protocol Workflow

1. Memory Update Phase:
   - Update the following core files with latest information:
     * activeContext.md: Current focus and state
     * progress.md: Working features and known issues
     * tasks.md: Current task status and next actions
     * systemPatterns.md: If architectural changes were made
     * techContext.md: If technology changes were made
     * projectRules.md: If new patterns or preferences were established

2. Session Summary Creation:
   - Create a session summary in activeContext.md using this format:
     ```markdown
     ## 📊 SESSION SUMMARY (YYYY-MM-DD)

     ### Accomplishments
     - [Brief description of completed work]

     ### Current State
     - [Description of the current system state]
     - [Current task progress: N%]

     ### Next Actions
     1. [Specific next step with detailed context]
     2. [Another specific next step]

     ### Open Questions
     - [Question that needs resolution]
     - [Decision that needs to be made]

     ### Critical Notes
     - [Any information essential for continuation]
     ```

3. Memory Archival Phase:
   - Version active files that have changed:
     * Copy to short-term/ directory with date suffix
   - Archive important information to long-term/:
     * Move session summary to episodic/sessions/
     * Add new discoveries to semantic/domain/
     * Document new workflows in procedural/workflows/
     * Archive design decisions in creative/

4. Verification Phase:
   - Verify consistency across all memory files
   - Ensure all architectural decisions are documented
   - Confirm current state is accurately reflected
   - Validate working features and issues are up-to-date

5. Completion Confirmation:
   - Provide final confirmation:
     ```markdown
     ## ✅ BEDTIME PROTOCOL COMPLETE

     The memory preservation protocol has been successfully executed. All critical
     information has been documented and the system state has been preserved.

     Memory files updated:
     - [list of updated files]

     Continuation point established in activeContext.md

     You may safely end this session.
