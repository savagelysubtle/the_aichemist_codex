# Product Context

## üîç Problem Statement

AI assistants suffer from memory limitations that prevent them from maintaining
context between sessions, resulting in repeated explanations, lost project
context, and diminished productivity. The "AI amnesia problem" requires users to
constantly reexplain their requirements, previous decisions, and project
details - creating frustration and inefficiency when working on complex projects
over time.
