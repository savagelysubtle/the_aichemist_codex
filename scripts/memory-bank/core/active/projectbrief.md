# Project Brief

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank is a comprehensive framework designed to solve the AI
assistant amnesia problem by creating a structured external memory system. The
project aims to create a GitHub repository containing the complete
implementation, documentation, and examples of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system,
making it accessible to the broader developer community while properly
attributing original inspirations.

With recent enhancements, the system now includes a scientifically-grounded
cognitive memory model, comprehensive command system, platform awareness
capabilities, memory diagnostics, and enhanced creative processes - providing a
complete framework for AI memory management across sessions.
