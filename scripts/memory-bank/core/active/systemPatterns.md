# System Patterns

This document outlines the system architecture, technical decisions, and
component relationships for the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system.

## System Diagram

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0 implements a hierarchical, modular architecture
composed of seven main layers that work together to maintain perfect context
between sessions. The architecture combines the original BIG BRAIN memory
framework with enhanced components to create a robust, adaptable memory
structure.

The system architecture is documented using standardized Mermaid diagrams
located in the `/images` directory, with generated image files in
`/docs/assets`. These diagrams follow the styling conventions defined in the
diagram standards rule.

Key architectural diagrams include:

- **System Architecture**: High-level view of all architectural layers
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Organization of memory files and directories
- **Rule System Structure**: Rule categories and relationships
- **Command Protocol**: Command structure and processing flow
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Workflow types and execution processes

These diagrams are maintained in Mermaid format (.mermaid) to ensure they can be
easily updated, versioned, and regenerated as the system evolves.
