## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher (PowerShell Core 7.x recommended)
- Bash (for Linux/macOS users)
- Git (for version control operations)

### Initial Setup

To set up the memory bank for the first time:

```powershell
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd path\to\scripts

# Initialize the memory bank system
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category update -Command init
```

This initializes the directory structure, creates necessary files, and sets up the rules system.

## Using the BIG Command System

The BIG Command System provides a unified interface for all memory bank operations. All commands follow this pattern:

```
BIG [category] [command] [parameters] [--options]
```

### Common Operations

#### Health Check

```powershell
# Run a health check on the memory bank
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category analytics -Command health
```

#### Generate Statistics

```powershell
# Generate detailed statistics about the memory bank
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category analytics -Command stats -IncludeDetails
```

#### Create Reports

```powershell
# Generate an HTML report
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category analytics -Command report -Format HTML
```

#### Organize Content

```powershell
# Reorganize content based on rules
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category organization -Command reorganize
```

#### Manage Rules

```powershell
# List all rules
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category rules -Command list

# Add a new rule
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category rules -Command add -RuleId org-001 -Category organization -Description "Move markdown files to semantic memory" -Pattern "*.md" -Action move-to-semantic
```

#### End-of-Session Protocol

```powershell
# Start the bedtime protocol
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category bedtime -Command start

# Complete the bedtime protocol
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category bedtime -Command complete
```

#### System Updates

```powershell
# Update the system
.\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category update -Command system
```

## Step-by-Step Workflows

### Daily Usage Workflow

1. **Start your session**:
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\scripts
   ```

2. **Check memory bank health**:
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category analytics -Command health
   ```

3. **Organize content** (if needed):
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category organization -Command reorganize
   ```

4. **Work with your memory bank** (add files, update content, etc.)

5. **End your session**:
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category bedtime -Command start
   # Review the summary
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category bedtime -Command complete
   ```

### Weekly Maintenance Workflow

1. **Update the system**:
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category update -Command system
   ```

2. **Validate rules**:
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category rules -Command validate
   ```

3. **Apply rules**:
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category rules -Command apply
   ```

4. **Generate a comprehensive report**:
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category analytics -Command report -Format HTML
   ```

5. **Clean up unnecessary files**:
   ```powershell
   .\BIG-Commands\BIG.ps1 -Category organization -Command cleanup
   ```

## Utility Batch Files

The scripts directory also contains several batch files for specific operations:

- `update_docs.bat`: Updates documentation
- `protect-branch-content.bat`: Protects branch content during Git operations
- `merge-to-main.bat`: Merges changes to the main branch

## Advanced Usage

For advanced usage and detailed information about each command category, refer to the respective README files:

- [BIG Command System](BIG-Commands/README-Main.md)
- [Analytics Commands](BIG-Commands/README.md)
- [Organization Commands](BIG-Commands/README-Organization.md)
- [Bedtime Protocol](BIG-Commands/README-Bedtime.md)
- [Rules System](BIG-Commands/README-Rules.md)
- [Update System](BIG-Commands/README-Update.md)

## Extending the System

To extend the system with new functionality:

1. Create new scripts in the appropriate directory
2. If adding a new command category, create a script named `BIG-CategoryName.ps1` in the `BIG-Commands` directory
3. Create a README file documenting the commands
4. Update the `BIG.ps1` script to include the new category

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the log files in the `logs` directory
2. Verify that you have the required permissions for file operations
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. For PowerShell scripts, you may need to adjust the execution policy:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
