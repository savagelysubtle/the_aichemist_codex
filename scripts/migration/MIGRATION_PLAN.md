# AIchemist Codex - Comprehensive Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step migration plan for restructuring the
AIchemist Codex codebase. The goal is to transform the current structure into a
more modular and maintainable organization following the design in the
core_module_rename.md document.

## Current Structure Analysis

The current structure organizes code under:

- `src/the_aichemist_codex/backend/core/file_reader/` - File reading, parsing,
  and metadata extraction
- `src/the_aichemist_codex/backend/core/metadata/` - Metadata management
- `src/the_aichemist_codex/backend/core/file_manager/` - File operations and
  management

## Target Structure

The target structure organizes code into more focused modules:

- `src/the_aichemist_codex/core/` - Core module containing domain logic
  - `filesystem/` - File handling operations
  - `parsing/` - Content parsing
  - `extraction/` - Data extraction
  - `versioning/` - Git operations
  - `analysis/` - Code analysis
  - `relations/` - Module relationships
  - ... (other modules as defined in core_module_rename.md)

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Structure Creation (create_structure.json)

1. Create new directory structure for all modules
2. Create initial **init**.py files
3. Create base model and interface files

### Phase 2: Core File Migration (move_files.json)

1. Move FileMetadata class to filesystem module
2. Move FileReader class to filesystem module
3. Move parsers to parsing module
4. Move ocr_parser to parsing module
5. Move metadata manager to extraction module
6. Update all import statements for moved files

### Phase 3: Additional Modules Migration (planned future configurations)

1. Move file_manager components to appropriate modules
2. Move tagging components
3. Move analysis components

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification

1. Run unit tests to verify functionality
2. Check for broken imports
3. Verify that all features work as expected

## Execution Strategy

To minimize disruption and ensure stability:

1. **Backup**: Create a backup branch or snapshot before beginning
2. **Incremental**: Execute each phase separately with testing in between
3. **Dry Run**: Always run in dry-run mode first to verify operations
4. **Verification**: After each phase, run tests to ensure functionality is
   preserved

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Phase 1: Structure Creation
python scripts/migration/codebase_restructure.py --config scripts/migration/create_structure.json --dry-run
python scripts/migration/codebase_restructure.py --config scripts/migration/create_structure.json

# Phase 2: Core File Migration
python scripts/migration/codebase_restructure.py --config scripts/migration/move_files.json --dry-run
python scripts/migration/codebase_restructure.py --config scripts/migration/move_files.json

# Phase 3-4: Future phases will be planned based on the success of Phases 1-2
```

## Rollback Strategy

If issues are encountered:

1. Use git to revert changes (if using version control)
2. Execute rollback operations (if provided in the script)
3. Restore from backup if necessary

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All files are correctly placed in the new structure
2. All imports are updated correctly
3. All tests pass
4. The application runs without errors
5. No duplicate code exists across the codebase

## Monitoring

During the migration process, monitor:

1. Test results
2. Runtime errors
3. Import errors
4. Performance impacts
