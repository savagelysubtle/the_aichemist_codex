## Current Focus

Implementing BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0 enhancements - Phase 5: Section
Checkpoint System (Complexity Level 4 with enhanced system visualization using
standardized Mermaid diagrams

## Recent Changes

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system is being enhanced with components from the
Vanzan Memory Bank system through a Level 4 implementation plan. The major
enhancements include:

- Added comprehensive Mermaid diagram support:
  - Created diagram standards rule to establish formatting and styling
    conventions
  - Developed five key system architecture diagrams (system architecture, memory
    bank structure, rule system, command protocol, workflow orchestration
  - Implemented PowerShell script for automated diagram generation
  - Updated documentation to reference visual architecture representations
  - Added directory structure and README for diagram management
- Completed Phase 4: Creative Phase Enhancements with four major components:
  - Creative Process Structure for systematic approaches to design-intensive
    tasks
  - Evaluation Metrics System for objective assessment of design solutions
  - Quality Verification Procedures for validating designs against requirements
  - Artifact Management System for organizing and preserving design knowledge

## üîç Problem Statement

AI assistants suffer from memory limitations that prevent them from maintaining
context between sessions, resulting in repeated explanations, lost project
context, and diminished productivity. The "AI amnesia problem" requires users to
constantly reexplain their requirements, previous decisions, and project
details - creating frustration and inefficiency when working on complex projects
over time.

## üë• User Personas

### Software Developer with Long-Running Projects

- **Background**: Professional developer working on complex projects spanning
  weeks or months
- **Goals**: Maintain continuity in AI assistance across many sessions, preserve
  architectural decisions
- **Frustrations**: Constantly reexplaining project context, repeating
  requirements, losing decision history
- **How Our Product Helps**: Provides structured memory system that preserves
  all project context between sessions

### Technical Writer or Documentation Specialist

- **Background**: Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation for software
  projects
- **Goals**: Ensure consistent documentation style and approach across long-term
  projects

## üìä SECTION CHECKPOINT: Foundation Layer Implementation

**Status**: COMPLETE **Verification**: VERIFIED

### üìå Section Summary

Successfully implemented the Foundation Layer of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0,
establishing the core infrastructure for the enhanced system. This phase created
the essential components that will support all other layers in the architecture.

### üîç Key Implementation Details

- Created six rule files implementing each foundation layer component:
  - Enhanced Complexity Framework (040-enhanced-complexity-framework.mdc
  - Reference Verification System (050-reference-verification-system.mdc
  - Task Escalation Protocol (060-task-escalation-protocol.mdc
  - Section Checkpoint System (070-section-checkpoint-system.mdc
  - Creative Phase Metrics (080-creative-phase-metrics.mdc
  - BIG Command Protocol (090-big-command-protocol.mdc
- Updated main.mdc to reflect the new layered architecture
- Updated systemPatterns.md with comprehensive system diagram
- Updated activeContext.md with current implementation status
- Established clear interfaces between all foundation components

### üìã Verification Steps

- [‚úì] All foundation layer rule files created with proper MDC format
- [‚úì] Each component follows consistent documentation standards

# Project Brief

## üìã Project Overview

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank is a comprehensive framework designed to solve the AI
assistant amnesia problem by creating a structured external memory system. The
project aims to create a GitHub repository containing the complete
implementation, documentation, and examples of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system,
making it accessible to the broader developer community while properly
attributing original inspirations.

With recent enhancements, the system now includes a scientifically-grounded
cognitive memory model, comprehensive command system, platform awareness
capabilities, memory diagnostics, and enhanced creative processes - providing a
complete framework for AI memory management across sessions.

## üéØ Core Requirements

- Create a well-organized GitHub repository with the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank
  implementation
- Provide proper attribution to original works by Vanzan and ipenywis
- Include comprehensive documentation on using and implementing the system
- Maintain a clear directory structure that separates public content from
  personal implementations
- Create a system that preserves AI memory across sessions with minimal user
  effort
- Implement a scientifically-grounded cognitive memory model for improved
  information management
- Provide a comprehensive command system for memory operations
- Support cross-platform compatibility through platform awareness

# System Patterns

This document outlines the system architecture, technical decisions, and
component relationships for the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system.

## System Diagram

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0 implements a hierarchical, modular architecture
composed of seven main layers that work together to maintain perfect context
between sessions. The architecture combines the original BIG BRAIN memory
framework with enhanced components to create a robust, adaptable memory
structure.

The system architecture is documented using standardized Mermaid diagrams
located in the `/images` directory, with generated image files in
`/docs/assets`. These diagrams follow the styling conventions defined in the
diagram standards rule.

![System Architecture](../../../docs/assets/system-architecture.png

Key architectural diagrams include:

- **System Architecture**: High-level view of all architectural layers
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Organization of memory files and directories
- **Rule System Structure**: Rule categories and relationships
- **Command Protocol**: Command structure and processing flow
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Workflow types and execution processes

These diagrams are maintained in Mermaid format (.mermaid to ensure they can be
easily updated, versioned, and regenerated as the system evolves.
