## Current Status

The File Relationship Mapping feature has made significant progress with the implementation of several core components:

1. **Relationship Model (`relationship.py`)**
   - Defined relationship data structures
   - Implemented relationship types and attributes
   - Created serialization methods

2. **Relationship Detection Framework (`detector.py`)**
   - Created abstract detector interface
   - Implemented detector registration system
   - Set up detection strategy enumeration
   - Started implementing language-specific import detectors

3. **Relationship Storage (`store.py`)**
   - Implemented SQLite-based storage
   - Created CRUD operations for relationships
   - Added batch operations for efficiency
   - Implemented query methods for relationship retrieval

4. **Relationship Graph (`graph.py`)**
   - Implemented graph construction from relationships
   - Created path finding algorithms
   - Added cluster detection
   - Implemented centrality metrics
   - Started graph visualization exports

### 3. Develop CLI Interface (1 day)

- **Design CLI Commands Structure**
  - Create structured command hierarchy
  - Define consistent parameter patterns
  - Document command usage

- **Implement Core Commands**
  - `detect`: Run relationship detection on files/directories
  - `list`: List relationships for a file
  - `find`: Find files related to a given file
  - `path`: Find paths between files
  - `visualize`: Generate visualization of relationships
  - `metrics`: Calculate and display centrality metrics

### 4. Integration with Existing System (1 day)

   - Format conversion capabilities

## Success Criteria

The File Relationship Mapping feature will be considered complete when:

1. Users can detect relationships between files using various strategies
2. Relationships can be stored, queried, and visualized
3. The CLI provides a complete interface for relationship operations
4. The feature is integrated with existing tagging and search capabilities
5. All tests pass and documentation is complete
