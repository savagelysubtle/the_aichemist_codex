# The Aichemist Codex - System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

The Aichemist Codex is a sophisticated Python-based project analysis and organization tool designed to provide automated code analysis, documentation generation, and file organization capabilities. The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns and employs modern Python async/await patterns for efficient I/O operations.

### Core Capabilities

- Dynamic file tree generation
- Code analysis and summarization
- Project documentation generation
- File organization and management
- Multiple output format support (JSON, Markdown)

## 2. Architecture & Components

### 2.1 Core Modules

#### Backend Module

- Entry point (main.py) implementing a Tkinter-based GUI
- Handles user interaction and directory selection
- Coordinates execution of analysis and generation tasks
- Manages output file creation and error handling

#### Config Module

- Configuration management via singleton pattern (config_loader.py)
- Dynamic rule processing (rules_engine.py)
- TOML-based configuration files
- Centralized settings management

#### File Management Module

- File tree generation and traversal (file_tree.py)
- Safe file operations with error handling
- Directory monitoring and change detection
- Permission validation and safety checks

#### Project Analysis Module

- AST-based Python code analysis (code_summary.py)
- Function and class detection
- Docstring extraction
- Token counting and metrics
- Jupyter notebook processing

#### Output Formatter Module

- Multiple format support (JSON, Markdown, HTML, CSV)
- Consistent formatting across outputs
- Structured documentation generation

### 2.2 Design Patterns

#### Architectural Patterns

- Modular Design: Clear separation of concerns
- Singleton Pattern: Used for configuration management

## 5. Data Flow

### 5.1 Analysis Pipeline

1. User selects input directory
2. File tree generation
3. Code analysis and parsing
4. Documentation generation
5. Output formatting
6. File organization (if enabled)

### 5.2 Error Handling Flow

1. Error detection
2. Logging
3. Recovery attempt
4. Rollback if necessary
5. User notification

## 6. Conclusion

The Aichemist Codex demonstrates a well-structured, modular architecture that prioritizes safety, efficiency, and extensibility. The use of modern Python features and established design patterns creates a robust foundation for code analysis and documentation generation. Future improvements can build upon this solid architectural base to extend functionality while maintaining system integrity.
