These notes might benefit from direct connections (based on shared references):

| Note 1 | Note 2 | Confidence |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| [[activeContext]] | [[progress]] | 0.60 |
| [[activeContext]] | [[mcp-integration]] | 0.40 |
| [[activeContext]] | [[productContext]] | 0.40 |
| [[activeContext]] | [[projectbrief]] | 0.40 |

## Integration with Sequential Thinking

You can use the Sequential Thinking Tools to explore these potential connections:

```json
{
  "tool": "sequentialthinking_tools",
  "parameters": {
    "thought": "I need to evaluate potential missing connections between notes in my knowledge base",
    "next_thought_needed": true,
    "thought_number": 1,
    "total_thoughts": 3
  }
}
```

This analysis is designed to help you maintain a well-connected knowledge web. Consider reviewing orphaned notes and potential missing connections to strengthen your knowledge graph.
