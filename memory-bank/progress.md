## MCP Integration Updates

### Memory Bank Structure Enhancement (March 28, 2023)

#### Overview
Enhanced the MCP integration with specialized tools for working with the memory-bank folder structure. This update allows for better navigation, context-awareness, and utilization of the memory bank's hierarchical organization.

#### Implemented Features
1. **New MCP Tools**:
   - `list_memory_structure`: Provides a complete overview of the Memory Bank structure
   - `get_category_notes`: Retrieves notes from specific categories by prefix or name
   - `analyze_memory_bank_structure`: Generates statistics and insights about the Memory Bank
   - `get_current_context`: Extracts structured information from activeContext.md

2. **Documentation**:
   - Created `memory-bank-structure.md` to document the memory bank organization
   - Updated `mcp-integration.md` with new tool documentation
   - Added progress tracking in this document

3. **Structure Formalization**:
   - Recognized and documented the numeric prefix categorization system
   - Established patterns for consistent folder organization
   - Created guidelines for maintaining the memory bank structure

#### Benefits
- Improved AI agent navigation of the knowledge repository
- Enhanced context-awareness for assistants using the MCP
- Better organization and discoverability of knowledge assets
- Standardized approach to memory bank maintenance

#### Next Steps
- Create and integrate note creation templates based on categories
- Implement tag analytics for better relationship mapping
- Enhance YAML frontmatter parsing for structured metadata
- Consider AI-assisted link suggestions between related notes

## Relationship Management MCP Integration

Implemented a comprehensive set of MCP tools for relationship management in the AIchemist Codex:

1. **New MCP Relationship Tools**:
   - `create_relationship`: Create relationships between files with customizable types and metadata
   - `list_relationships`: Explore both incoming and outgoing relationships for files
   - `delete_relationship`: Remove relationships with flexible targeting options
   - `get_relationship_types`: Access standardized relationship type definitions
   - `visualize_relationships`: Generate visual representations of file relationships

2. **Enhanced RelationshipManager**:
   - Added relationship network traversal capabilities
   - Implemented bidirectional relationship handling
   - Enhanced visualization support with multiple formats (text, mermaid, dot)
   - Created metadata-rich relationship tracking

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added comprehensive tool documentation to MCP integration guide
   - Included usage examples for all relationship tools
   - Documented the relationship data model

4. **Integration Benefits**:
   - AI assistants can now discover and understand file relationships
   - Relationship visualization provides insight into codebase structure
   - Semantic relationship creation enables better code understanding
   - Graph-based traversal adds context to file operations

This enhancement allows AI agents to better understand the codebase structure by tracking explicit relationships between files, both manual and automatically detected. This is particularly valuable for navigation, understanding dependencies, and maintaining architectural boundaries.

Next steps include implementing automatic relationship detection across different file types and languages, and developing AI-assisted relationship suggestions based on content analysis.
