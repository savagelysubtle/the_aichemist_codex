## Current Status

The AIChemist Codex is in early development with a focus on core architecture
and fundamental capabilities. We have established the project foundation and are
now enhancing it with modern architectural patterns including:

1. **Modernized Registry Pattern**: Enhancing with contextual service resolution
   and lifecycle management
2. **Async-First Architecture**: Implementing high-performance async processing
   with asyncio and mmap
3. **Vector-Based Search**: Developing semantic search capabilities with
   embeddings
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Building systems to detect and visualize content
   relationships
5. **Plugin Architecture**: Creating extensible framework for adding
   capabilities

The current sprint focuses on implementing these architectural enhancements and
beginning work on the advanced content analysis systems. The project is on track
according to the development roadmap.
