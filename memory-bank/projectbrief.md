# Project Brief: The AIchemist Codex

## Overview

The AIchemist Codex is a sophisticated software system designed to manage, analyze, and process code and rules in an intelligent way. The project name suggests it serves as a repository of knowledge ("Codex") with AI capabilities ("AIchemist").

## Core Requirements

1. Command-line interface for user interaction
2. Modular and extensible architecture
3. Clean separation of concerns
4. Support for plugins and extensions
5. Robust documentation and testing

## Project Goals

- Provide a powerful CLI tool for code/rules management
- Maintain high code quality and maintainability
- Enable easy extension and customization
- Ensure robust error handling and logging
- Support comprehensive testing at all levels

## Technical Vision

The project follows a clean/hexagonal architecture pattern with clear separation between:

- Domain logic
- Application services
- Infrastructure concerns
- Interface adapters

This architectural approach ensures:

- Business logic isolation
- Technology independence
- Testability
- Maintainability
- Flexibility for future changes
