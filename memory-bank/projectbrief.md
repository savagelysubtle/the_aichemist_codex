# The AIChemist Codex - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The AIChemist Codex is an advanced file management and knowledge extraction
system designed to transform how users interact with files and documents. It
leverages AI and machine learning to provide intelligent file organization,
content analysis, and relationship mapping, making it easier to find,
understand, and utilize information across digital workspaces.

## Core Requirements

### System Architecture

- Implement a domain-driven design architecture
- Create a modular, extensible system with well-defined interfaces
- Utilize the Registry pattern for dependency injection
- Follow Python best practices and modern development standards
- Maintain a layered architecture: core → infrastructure → domain → services →
  application

### File Management Capabilities

- Asynchronous file operations with high-performance I/O
- Rule-based file organization with customizable rules
- Rollback system with comprehensive transaction management
- Duplicate detection across workspaces

### Content Analysis Features

- Comprehensive metadata extraction from diverse file types
- MIME type detection for proper file handling
- File relationship mapping based on content, references, and structure
- Intelligent auto-tagging using advanced NLP techniques

### Search & Retrieval Functionality

- Multi-modal search (full-text, metadata, fuzzy, semantic)
- File similarity detection and content clustering
- Advanced filtering based on tags, metadata, relationships, or content

### Performance & Security Considerations

- Efficient caching system with LRU and TTL support
- Parallel processing for handling large datasets
- Secure configuration storage for sensitive values

## Project Goals

1. Create a robust, extensible file management system
2. Develop intelligent content analysis capabilities
3. Implement advanced search and relationship mapping
4. Build a user-friendly CLI and potential GUI interface
5. Ensure excellent performance, security, and reliability
6. Provide comprehensive documentation and testing

## Success Criteria

- All core features implemented and working as specified
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Well-documented codebase with clear architectural patterns
- Efficient performance with large file collections
- Positive user feedback on usability and functionality
