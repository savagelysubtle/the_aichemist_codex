# The AIChemist Codex - Active Context

## Current Focus

The AIChemist Codex is in active early development, with focus on implementing
core architecture and high-performance components that will serve as the
foundation for the entire system. Current work centers on:

1. **High-Performance File Processing**: Implementing an advanced asynchronous
   file processor using memory-mapped I/O and producer-consumer patterns to
   efficiently handle large files.

2. **Relationship Mapping System**: Building a sophisticated system for
   detecting, storing, and analyzing relationships between files using vector
   embeddings and explicit references.

3. **Core Infrastructure Enhancement**: Strengthening the registry pattern,
   improving error handling, and ensuring thread-safety throughout the
   application.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the `AsyncFileProcessor` for efficient large file processing
- Created comprehensive detection strategies for the relationship mapping system
- Enhanced the registry system with lifecycle management
- Developed a robust exception hierarchy for consistent error handling
- Added vector-based similarity detection capabilities
- Implemented memory-mapped I/O for performance optimization
- Added directory-level relationship detection for batch processing

## Next Steps

1. Complete the integration of vector embeddings into the similarity detection
2. Add automated tests for the async file processor
3. Refine the reference detection to improve accuracy
4. Implement the relationship visualization system
5. Develop CLI commands for relationship management
6. Enhance the search capabilities with relationship context

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architectural Decisions

- **Async-First Architecture**: The system is designed with asynchronicity as a
  core principle, using Python's async/await syntax throughout.
- **Memory-Mapped I/O**: For large file processing, we're utilizing
  memory-mapped I/O to reduce memory usage and improve throughput.
- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: Implementing this pattern for file processing
  to balance CPU and I/O operations efficiently.
- **Strategy Pattern for Relationship Detection**: Using the strategy pattern to
  make the relationship detection system extensible and maintainable.
- **Registry Pattern**: Using a centralized registry to manage dependencies and
  service lifecycles.

### Technical Considerations

- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring changes don't break existing
  functionality, particularly in the registry system.
- **Circular Import Prevention**: Careful design to prevent circular
  dependencies between modules.
- **Memory Management**: Optimizing memory usage for large file operations using
  streaming and chunking.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensuring the registry and other shared resources are
  thread-safe for async operations.

### Design Considerations

- **Extensibility**: Making the relationship detection system extensible so new
  strategies can be added easily.
- **Performance vs. Accuracy**: Balancing the need for accurate relationship
  detection with performance requirements, particularly for large directories.
- **API Design**: Designing clean, intuitive interfaces for the relationship
  system and file processor.
- **Error Handling**: Providing clear, actionable error messages and proper
  error propagation.

## Current Challenges

1. **Vector Embedding Optimization**: Need to efficiently manage vector
   embeddings for large numbers of files.
2. **Relationship Accuracy**: Improving the accuracy of relationship detection,
   especially for implicit relationships.
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Resolving circular dependencies in the core
   interfaces and implementations.
4. **Performance Tuning**: Finding the optimal chunk size and worker count for
   different file sizes and processing scenarios.
5. **Memory Management**: Ensuring efficient memory usage during large file
   processing operations.
6. **Testing Async Code**: Developing effective testing strategies for
   asynchronous code.
7. **Scalability**: Ensuring the relationship mapping system scales well with
   large numbers of files and relationships.
