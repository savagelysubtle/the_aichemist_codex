## Recent Updates

### MCP Hub Improvements

- Fixed linter errors in the `aichemist_mcp_hub_new.py` file:
  - Added null checks for `self.current_class` to prevent "None is not subscriptable" errors
  - Refactored the `_get_attr_name` method to handle different node types safely
  - Improved type checking to make the code more resilient
- Enhanced the `ClassVisitor` class for better diagram generation
- These fixes improve the reliability of architecture-aware tools in the MCP Hub

### Sequential Thinking Tools Integration

The AIchemist project now includes integration with the Sequential Thinking Tools server:

- Added `mcp-sequentialthinking-tools` as a new MCP server in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- This tool provides intelligent step-by-step problem breakdown with tool recommendations
- Each recommendation includes confidence scores and detailed rationale
- Supports branching thoughts and revision of previous steps when needed
- Complements existing MCP capabilities by adding strategic planning
- Documentation available in `memory-bank/mcp-integration.md`
- Integrated with Obsidian tools to create a unified knowledge management workflow:
  - Creates connected knowledge webs through guided sequential thinking
  - Ensures proper linking between related knowledge components
  - Maintains context awareness across the entire knowledge base
  - Systematically builds and preserves relationships between notes
  - Provides a structured approach to growing the knowledge graph organically
  - See `memory-bank/mcp-integration.md` for implementation examples

### Enhanced Backlinks Integration

The AIchemist project now includes advanced backlink generation capabilities with integration to both MCP Hub and Sequential Thinking Tools:

- Enhanced `create_backlinks.py` with comprehensive knowledge relationship analysis
- Added metadata extraction from YAML frontmatter
- Implemented relationship analysis to identify potential connections
- Created confidence scoring system for suggested connections
- Developed new `update_metadata_and_backlinks.py` for MCP integration
- Added MCP tools for knowledge management:
  - `analyze_knowledge_connections` for comprehensive link analysis
  - `update_all_backlinks` for maintaining knowledge connections
- Integrated with Sequential Thinking Tools for guided knowledge management
- Created detailed documentation in `memory-bank/mcp-integration.md`
- Added new workflow examples in `memory-bank/sequential-thinking-obsidian-workflow.md`

This integration ensures the knowledge web continues to grow systematically as the codebase evolves.

### MCP Integration

The AIchemist project now includes MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with the following enhancements:

- Direct integration with memory-bank Obsidian vault
- `search_obsidian_notes` and `get_linked_notes` tools available through MCP
- Cursor configuration in `.cursor/mcp.json` for AI agent access
- Documentation in `memory-bank/mcp-integration.md`
- Improved exception chaining in MCP Hub for better error tracking
- Enhanced Sequential Thinking server integration with proper npx startup
- Standardized error handling patterns across MCP components

This integration enables AI agents to interact with the memory-bank knowledge base through standardized MCP tools. See `mcp-integration.md` for complete details on usage and capabilities.

### Current Technical Focus

- Optimizing Sequential Thinking server startup and management
- Implementing robust error handling with proper exception chaining
- Addressing linter issues while maintaining code clarity
- Improving server process management and monitoring

### Codebase Review Document

A comprehensive codebase review has been completed and documented in `memory-bank/codebase-review.md`. The document provides insights into:

- Architecture implementation details
- Current implementation status
- Design patterns used in the codebase
- Technical insights from the review
- Recommendations for future development

This review will guide ongoing development efforts and help prioritize enhancements to the AIchemist Codex.
