# Using Obsidian's Graph View

Obsidian's graph view provides a powerful way to visualize relationships in our codebase.

## Accessing Graph View
1. Click the graph icon in the left sidebar
2. Use Ctrl+G as a keyboard shortcut

## Using Filters
- Filter by tags to see specific aspects
- Filter by folders to focus on particular areas
- Use the "Depth" slider to control how many levels of connections to show

## Reading the Graph
- Larger nodes = more connections
- Colors indicate different types of notes (based on folders)
- Clustering shows related concepts

## Best Practices
- Always create bidirectional links
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Link to specific headings when appropriate
