# The AIChemist Codex - Product Context

## Problem Statement

Digital information is growing exponentially, creating challenges for users:

- **Information Overload**: Users struggle to manage large file collections
  efficiently
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Finding relevant information across different files
  is difficult

1. **Intelligent Organization**: Automating file organization based on content
   and metadata
2. **Enhanced Discovery**: Making information easier to find through multi-modal
   search
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Revealing connections between related documents
4. **Content Understanding**: Extracting and analyzing information across file
   formats
5. **Automated Workflows**: Reducing manual effort through intelligent
   automation

## Target Users

- **Researchers**: Managing research papers, data, and analysis files
- **Knowledge Workers**: Organizing documents, reports, and reference materials
