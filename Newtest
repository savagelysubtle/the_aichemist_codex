## Risk Assessment

### Potential Challenges

1. Performance degradation with real-time monitoring
2. Storage requirements for versioning system
3. Complexity in handling various file formats
4. Notification system reliability

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Implement efficient change detection with throttling
2. Design space-efficient versioning with configurable retention
3. Modular approach to file format handlers
4. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for notifications

## Integration Strategy

1. **Minimal dependencies on existing code**

   - Use well-defined interfaces to interact with other components
   - Avoid direct imports from unrelated modules
   - Use the notification system only through clean interfaces

2. **Separate configuration from implementation**

   - Store all settings in dedicated configuration files
   - Use dependency injection to provide components with their dependencies
   - Allow runtime reconfiguration where possible

3. **Event-based communication**

   - Use an event bus for publishing and subscribing to changes
   - Avoid tight coupling between file tracking and version control
   - Allow components to be used independently

4. **Phased rollout and testing**
   - Complete each component before integration
   - Comprehensive unit tests for each class
   - Integration tests for component combinations
   - End-to-end tests for the full workflow

## Success Metrics

- File change detection latency < 2 seconds
- Version history retrieval time < 500ms
- Storage efficiency: versions use < 2x original file size
- CPU usage < 5% during idle monitoring
- Memory footprint < 100MB for tracking 10,000 files
