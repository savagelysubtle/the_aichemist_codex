## Next Steps Plan

### 1. Monitoring & Change Tracking Implementation (High Priority)

After a deep review of the existing file watcher, rollback, and logging systems,
here's a detailed implementation plan:

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Real-Time File Tracking (Weeks 1-2)

##### Step 1: Improve FileEventHandler (Days 1-3)

- [x] Implement missing event handlers in FileEventHandler class:
  - [x] Add `on_deleted` method to track file deletions
  - [x] Add `on_moved` method to track file renames/moves
  - [x] Ensure proper rollback operations are recorded for all events
- [x] Add support for ignored directories/patterns via configuration

##### Step 2: Change Detection Algorithms (Days 4-7)

- [x] Create a `ChangeDetector` class to identify different types of changes:
  - [x] Implement content-based change detection for text files
  - [x] Add hash-based change detection for binary files
  - [x] Create "smart debounce" logic to handle rapid sequential changes
- [x] Add change severity classification (minor/major/critical changes)

##### Step 3: Change History Storage System (Days 8-10)

- [x] Create a `ChangeHistoryManager` class that:
  - [x] Maintains a database of file changes (SQLite)
  - [x] Stores metadata about each change (timestamp, type, user, etc.)
  - [x] Provides APIs for querying change history by file or time range
  - [x] Implements clean-up policies for old change records

##### Step 4: Multi-Directory Support Enhancement (Days 11-14)

- [x] Optimize the existing multi-directory monitoring:
  - [x] Add priority-based monitoring (critical vs. non-critical directories)
  - [x] Implement resource throttling for high-change-rate directories
  - [x] Create recursive directory discovery with customizable depth
  - [x] Add dynamic directory registration/unregistration

#### Phase 2: File Versioning System (Weeks 3-4)

##### Step 1: Versioning Strategy Design (Days 1-3)

- [x] Design the versioning strategy:
  - [x] Create `VersionManager` class to coordinate versioning operations
  - [x] Implement configurable versioning policies (full copy vs. diff-based)
  - [x] Design storage structure for version history

##### Step 2: Historical Version Storage (Days 4-7)

- [x] Implement the storage mechanisms:
  - [x] Create efficient storage for full-file versions
  - [x] Implement diff-based storage for text files using `difflib`
  - [x] Add metadata storage for each version (timestamp, author, change reason)
  - [x] Create compression strategies for large files

##### Step 3: Diff Generation and Comparison (Days 8-10)

- [x] Create diff generation tools:
  - [x] Implement text file diff generation using unified diff format
  - [x] Add syntax highlighting for code file diffs
  - [x] Create binary file comparison for non-text files
  - [x] Optimize diff algorithms for large files

##### Step 4: Version Restoration System (Days 11-14)

- [x] Build the version restoration tools:
  - [x] Implement `restore_version(file_path, version_id)` function
  - [x] Add version browsing capabilities
  - [x] Create conflict resolution for concurrent changes
  - [x] Implement bulk restoration for multiple files

#### Phase 3: Notification System (Weeks 5-6)

##### Step 1: Notification Architecture (Days 1-3)

- [x] Design the notification architecture:
  - [x] Create `NotificationManager` class with a publisher-subscriber pattern
  - [x] Implement event categorization (file, system, security events)
  - [x] Design notification templates for different event types
  - [x] Add notification queuing for high-volume scenarios

##### Step 2: Notification Channels (Days 4-7)

- [x] Implement various notification channels:
  - [x] Create enhanced log-based notifications with structured logging
  - [x] Add email notifications with customizable templates
  - [x] Implement webhook support for external system integration
  - [x] Add in-app notification queue

##### Step 3: Notification Rules Engine (Days 8-10)

- [x] Build a rules engine for notifications:
  - [x] Create a DSL for defining notification rules
  - [x] Implement rule evaluation engine
  - [x] Add support for time-based and event-based rules
  - [x] Create rule testing/simulation capabilities

##### Step 4: Notification Dashboard (Days 11-14)

- [x] Develop a notification dashboard:
  - [x] Create a CLI-based dashboard showing recent notifications
  - [x] Implement notification statistics and analytics
  - [x] Add filtering and searching of notification history
  - [x] Create notification archiving and export capabilities

### 2. Expanded Format Support (Medium Priority)

#### Week 7-8: Binary & Specialized File Support

- Add image metadata extraction (EXIF)
- Implement audio file metadata support
- Create database file metadata extractors
- Build PDF content extraction
- Add video file metadata support

#### Week 9-10: Format Conversion

- Implement document conversion pipelines
- Add quality validation for conversions
- Create batch conversion functionality
- Build conversion API endpoints
- Add format-specific optimizations

### 3. Start Planning for Phase 3 (Lower Priority)

#### Week 11-12: AI-Powered Enhancement Planning

- Research ML models for search ranking
- Evaluate NLP libraries for context-aware search
- Design recommendation engine architecture
- Create proof-of-concept for content classification

## Implementation Approach

1. Follow test-driven development
2. Update documentation as features are implemented
3. Create detailed design docs before implementation
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Schedule bi-weekly progress reviews

This plan will complete the remaining items in Phase 2 over the next 12 weeks,
while laying groundwork for Phase 3.

## Resource Allocation

### Personnel Needs

- 2 backend developers for core implementation
- 1 ML/AI specialist for search and classification
- 1 QA engineer for testing
- 1 technical writer for documentation

### Technology Stack Additions

- `watchdog` for file system monitoring
- `LibGit2` or similar for versioning
- Image libraries: `Pillow`, `ExifRead`
- Audio libraries: `pydub`, `mutagen`
- PDF processing: `PyPDF2`, `pdf2image`
- Email: `smtplib` or third-party service
- Webhooks: Custom implementation with `FastAPI`

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Challenges

1. Performance degradation with real-time monitoring
2. Storage requirements for versioning system
3. Complexity in handling various file formats
4. Notification system reliability

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Implement efficient change detection with throttling
2. Design space-efficient versioning with configurable retention
3. Modular approach to file format handlers
4. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for notifications

## Success Metrics

- File change detection latency < 2 seconds
- Version history retrieval time < 500ms
- Format conversion success rate > 95%
- Notification delivery success rate > 99%
- System resource usage increase < 15%

## Timeline Overview

- Weeks 1-6: Monitoring & Change Tracking
- Weeks 7-10: Expanded Format Support
- Weeks 11-12: AI Planning & Preparation
- Week 13: Review & Planning for Phase 3
