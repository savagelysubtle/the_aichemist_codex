# The Aichemist Codex: Implementation Plan

## Current Status

âœ… **Phase 1: Core Improvements** - Fully completed
- File I/O standardization
- Rollback system
- File management
- Search & retrieval
- Performance & scalability optimizations
- Security & compliance

âœ… **Phase 2: Partial Completion**
- Advanced Search & Content Analysis - Completed
- Smart File Organization - Completed
- File Relationship Mapping - Completed

ðŸŽ¯ **Current Focus Areas** (not yet completed):
- Monitoring & Change Tracking
- Expanded Format Support

## Next Steps Plan

### 1. Monitoring & Change Tracking (High Priority)

#### Week 1-2: Real-Time File Tracking
- Implement file system watcher using `watchdog` library
- Create change detection algorithms for:
  - File modifications
  - New files
  - Deletions
  - Moves/renames
- Build change history storage system
- Implement multi-directory support

#### Week 3-4: File Versioning
- Design versioning strategy (full copies vs. diffs)
- Implement efficient storage for historical versions
- Create diff generation for text-based files
- Build version comparison visualization
- Add version restoration functionality

#### Week 5-6: Notification System
- Design event-based notification architecture
- Implement notification channels:
  - Log-based notifications
  - Email notifications
  - Webhook support for external systems
- Create configurable notification rules
- Add threshold-based notifications
- Build notification dashboard

### 2. Expanded Format Support (Medium Priority)

#### Week 7-8: Binary & Specialized File Support
- Add image metadata extraction (EXIF)
- Implement audio file metadata support
- Create database file metadata extractors
- Build PDF content extraction
- Add video file metadata support

#### Week 9-10: Format Conversion
- Implement document conversion pipelines
- Add quality validation for conversions
- Create batch conversion functionality
- Build conversion API endpoints
- Add format-specific optimizations

### 3. Start Planning for Phase 3 (Lower Priority)

#### Week 11-12: AI-Powered Enhancement Planning
- Research ML models for search ranking
- Evaluate NLP libraries for context-aware search
- Design recommendation engine architecture
- Create proof-of-concept for content classification

## Implementation Approach

1. Follow test-driven development
2. Update documentation as features are implemented
3. Create detailed design docs before implementation
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Schedule bi-weekly progress reviews

This plan will complete the remaining items in Phase 2 over the next 12 weeks, while laying groundwork for Phase 3.

## Resource Allocation

### Personnel Needs
- 2 backend developers for core implementation
- 1 ML/AI specialist for search and classification
- 1 QA engineer for testing
- 1 technical writer for documentation

### Technology Stack Additions
- `watchdog` for file system monitoring
- `LibGit2` or similar for versioning
- Image libraries: `Pillow`, `ExifRead`
- Audio libraries: `pydub`, `mutagen`
- PDF processing: `PyPDF2`, `pdf2image`
- Email: `smtplib` or third-party service
- Webhooks: Custom implementation with `FastAPI`

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Challenges
1. Performance degradation with real-time monitoring
2. Storage requirements for versioning system
3. Complexity in handling various file formats
4. Notification system reliability

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement efficient change detection with throttling
2. Design space-efficient versioning with configurable retention
3. Modular approach to file format handlers
4. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for notifications

## Success Metrics

- File change detection latency < 2 seconds
- Version history retrieval time < 500ms
- Format conversion success rate > 95%
- Notification delivery success rate > 99%
- System resource usage increase < 15%

## Timeline Overview

- Weeks 1-6: Monitoring & Change Tracking
- Weeks 7-10: Expanded Format Support
- Weeks 11-12: AI Planning & Preparation
- Week 13: Review & Planning for Phase 3
