API Reference
============

This section provides detailed API documentation for The AIchemist Codex.

.. note::
   The AIchemist Codex has been migrated to a new domain-driven architecture.
   Legacy documentation is marked with "(Legacy)" in the title, and
   current implementation documentation can be found under the domain directories.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   domain/index
   legacy

.. note::
   **Standard documentation format for all modules**

   All module documentation should follow these heading styles:

   * Module Title: = characters (same length as the title)
   * Section Level 1: - characters (same length as the title)
   * Section Level 2: ^ characters (same length as the title)
   * Section Level 3: " characters (same length as the title)

   Example:

   .. code-block:: rst

      Module Title
      ===========

      Section Level 1
      --------------

      Section Level 2
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      Section Level 3
      """"""""""""""

   This ensures consistent heading styles throughout the documentation.
