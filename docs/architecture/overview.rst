Architecture Overview
======================

The Aichemist Codex implements a layered clean architecture with domain-driven design principles. This architecture is designed to create a maintainable, testable, and scalable codebase with clear separation of concerns.

Core Architectural Principles
=============================

Clean Architecture
-----------------

The system follows Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture principles, organizing code into concentric layers:

    +----------------------------------------------------------+
    |                    INTERFACES LAYER                       |
    |  (CLI, API, Event Handlers, Stream processors, etc.)     |
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
                              |
                              v
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
    |                  APPLICATION LAYER                        |
    |  (Use Cases, Services, Commands, Queries, Handlers)       |
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
                              |
                              v
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
    |                     DOMAIN LAYER                          |
    |  (Entities, Value Objects, Repositories, Domain Services) |
    +----------------------------------------------------------+

Key principles:

* **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies always point inward. Inner layers know nothing about outer layers.
* **Domain-Centricity**: The domain layer is at the core and contains all business logic.
* **Framework Independence**: The domain and application layers are independent of frameworks and external concerns.

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
-------------------------

The architecture incorporates DDD concepts:

* **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared language between technical and domain experts
* **Bounded Contexts**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the domain
* **Entities**: Objects with identity and lifecycle
* **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity
* **Aggregates**: Clusters of associated objects that are treated as a unit
* **Repositories**: Provide abstraction over data storage
* **Domain Events**: Represent significant occurrences in the domain

Architecture Layers
==================

Domain Layer
-----------

The domain layer is the core of the application and contains:

* **Entities**: Domain objects with identity and lifecycle (e.g., Document, Tag)
* **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes (e.g., FileType, MetadataValue)
* **Domain Events**: Events that represent changes in the domain (e.g., FileCreated, TagAdded)
* **Repository Interfaces**: Contracts for data access without implementation details
* **Domain Services**: Stateless operations that don't naturally belong to entities
* **Domain Exceptions**: Specific exception types for domain errors

Application Layer
---------------

The application layer orchestrates the domain objects to perform tasks:

* **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules
* **Commands**: Operations that change state (e.g., CreateDocumentCommand)
* **Queries**: Operations that retrieve data without side effects (e.g., GetDocumentByIdQuery)
* **Command/Query Handlers**: Process commands and queries
* **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for passing data between layers
* **Application Services**: Orchestrate multiple operations

Infrastructure Layer
------------------

The infrastructure layer provides implementations for interfaces defined in inner layers:

* **Repository Implementations**: Concrete data access implementations
* **Persistence Adapters**: Database access and ORM integration
* **File Storage**: Concrete file system operations
* **Messaging**: Message bus implementations
* **External Services**: Integration with external systems
* **Caching**: Cache implementations

Interfaces Layer
--------------

The interfaces layer provides ways for users and external systems to interact with the application:

* **API Controllers**: HTTP/REST API endpoints
* **CLI Commands**: Command-line interface
* **Event Consumers**: Handle external events
* **GraphQL Resolvers**: GraphQL API support
* **GUI Controllers**: Desktop application interface

Cross-Cutting Concerns
=====================

Some concerns cut across multiple layers and are managed separately:

* **Logging**: Centralized logging system
* **Error Handling**: Consistent error management
* **Security**: Authentication and authorization
* **Validation**: Input validation
* **Telemetry**: Performance monitoring and metrics
* **Caching**: Multi-level caching strategy

Additional Components
===================

* **Plugin Architecture**: Extensibility through plugins
* **AI Integration**: AI capabilities and models
* **Legacy Code**: Managed in a separate module for gradual migration

Migration Strategy
================

The system is designed for incremental migration from the legacy architecture:

1. Define domain models and repository interfaces first
2. Implement use cases in the application layer
3. Add infrastructure implementations for repositories and services
4. Create interface adapters for API endpoints and CLI commands
5. Gradually migrate code from the legacy modules to the clean architecture
