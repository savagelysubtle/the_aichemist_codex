- **Disk Space**: At least 100MB for base installation, plus space for your
  files
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended

## Installation Methods

### Using pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install the-aichemist-codex
```

### For Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the_aichemist_codex.git
cd the_aichemist_codex
pip install -e .
```

### Using Poetry

```bash

### Docker Installation

```bash
docker pull aichemist/codex:latest
docker run -v /path/to/your/files:/data aichemist/codex
```

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Initialize a new codex**

   ```bash
   aichemist init /path/to/your/codex
   ```

2. **Add files to your codex**

   ```bash
   aichemist add /path/to/your/files
   ```

3. **Get tag suggestions**

   ```bash
   aichemist tag --suggest /path/to/your/files
   ```

4. **Apply tags automatically**

   ```bash
   aichemist tag --auto /path/to/your/files
   ```

5. **Search for content**
   ```bash
   aichemist search "your search query"
   ```

## Main Features

### File Management

- **Add Files**: Process and index files for search and organization
- **Organize Files**: Automatically organize files based on configurable rules
- **Find Duplicates**: Identify duplicate files and provide handling options

### Tagging System

- **Auto-Tagging**: Automatically generate and apply tags based on file content
- **Tag Suggestions**: Generate tag suggestions for review before applying
- **Manual Tagging**: Add or remove tags manually
- **Tag Management**: List, filter, and manage tags across your files

### Search Capabilities

- **Basic Search**: Search across all indexed files
- **Fuzzy Search**: Find approximate matches for search terms
- **Semantic Search**: Find conceptually similar content
- **Regex Search**: Use pattern matching with regular expressions
- **Filtered Search**: Search by file type, tag, date, etc.

### Relationship Mapping

- **Detect Relationships**: Analyze files to find connections between them
- **Find Related Files**: Discover files related to a specific file
- **Generate Relationship Maps**: Create visual graphs of file relationships

## Configuration

The Aichemist Codex can be configured via:

1. **YAML Configuration File**: Located at `~/.aichemist/config.yaml` by default
2. **Environment Variables**: Override file settings as needed
3. **Programmatic Configuration**: When using as a library in Python

### Data Directory Structure

The data directory contains the following subdirectories:

```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ backup/             # File backups for rollback operations
â”œâ”€â”€ cache/              # Temporary cache files
â”œâ”€â”€ exports/            # Exported analysis results
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/               # Application logs
â”œâ”€â”€ notifications/      # Stored notifications
â”œâ”€â”€ trash/              # Deleted files (temporary storage)
â””â”€â”€ versions/           # Version history
```

## Using as a Python Library

The Aichemist Codex can be integrated into your Python applications:

```python
import asyncio
from backend.src.file_reader import FileReader
from backend.src.metadata import MetadataManager
from backend.src.search import SearchEngine
from backend.src.tagging import TagManager, TagSuggester
from pathlib import Path

async def main():
    # Initialize components
    reader = FileReader()
    metadata_mgr = MetadataManager()
    search = SearchEngine()
    tag_manager = TagManager(Path(".aichemist/tags.db"))
    await tag_manager.initialize()
    suggester = TagSuggester(tag_manager)

    # Process a file
    file_path = Path("document.pdf")
    metadata = await reader.process_file(file_path)

    # Store metadata
    await metadata_mgr.add(metadata)

    # Get tag suggestions
    tag_suggestions = await suggester.suggest_tags(metadata)

    # Apply high-confidence tags automatically
    high_confidence_tags = [(tag, conf) for tag, conf in tag_suggestions if conf > 0.8]
    if high_confidence_tags:
        await tag_manager.add_file_tags(file_path, high_confidence_tags)

    # Search for content
    results = await search.search("important concept")

    # Print results
    for result in results:
        print(f"Found in: {result.path} (Score: {result.score})")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Summary

The Aichemist Codex is a powerful tool for organizing, analyzing, and extracting
knowledge from your files. Its AI-powered features help you discover
relationships between files, automatically organize content, and efficiently
find information across your file collection. The system is designed to be both
powerful and flexible, with options to use it via command line or as a Python
library in your own applications. Currently in active development, the project
is focused on Phase 2 enhancements with real-time file tracking and versioning
as the current priorities.
