Architecture Overview
===================

The AIchemist Codex follows a domain-driven design (DDD) architecture to organize the codebase in a maintainable and scalable manner. This document provides an overview of the architecture, design principles, and how different components interact.

Architecture Layers
------------------

The architecture is organized into distinct layers:

1. **Core Layer**

   The foundation of the system, containing common utilities, constants, interfaces, and basic models that are used across the entire application.

2. **Domain Layer**

   The heart of the application, containing domain-specific logic organized into separate modules, each representing a distinct business domain.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**

   Provides implementations for external services, databases, file systems, and other technical concerns.

4. **Services Layer**

   Orchestrates the interactions between different domains and exposes a unified API for application features.

5. **API Layer**

   Exposes the application's capabilities through various interfaces (REST, CLI, etc.).

6. **UI Layer**

   Provides user interfaces for interacting with the application.

Domain Organization
------------------

Each domain is organized into the following components:

* **Models**: Data structures representing domain concepts
* **Services**: Business logic specific to the domain
* **Repositories**: Data access interfaces and implementations
* **Factories**: Creation of complex domain objects
* **Events**: Domain events and event handlers
* **Exceptions**: Domain-specific exceptions

Key Design Principles
-------------------

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   Each domain is responsible for a specific area of functionality, with clear boundaries between domains.

2. **Dependency Inversion**

   High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules. Both depend on abstractions.

3. **Single Responsibility**

   Each class and module has a single, well-defined responsibility.

4. **Interface Segregation**

   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

5. **Registry Pattern**

   A central registry is used to manage dependencies and prevent circular imports.

Communication Between Domains
---------------------------

Domains communicate through:

1. **Service Dependencies**: Domains can declare dependencies on services from other domains through interfaces.
2. **Domain Events**: Domains can publish events that other domains can subscribe to.
3. **Shared Models**: Common models defined in the core layer can be used across domains.

Dependency Management
-------------------

Dependencies are managed through:

1. **Explicit Imports**: Dependencies are explicitly imported and declared.
2. **Registry Pattern**: A central registry is used to resolve dependencies at runtime.
3. **Interface-based Design**: Dependencies are defined in terms of interfaces, not implementations.
