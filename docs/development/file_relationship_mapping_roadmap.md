# File Relationship Mapping: Development Roadmap

## Overview

The File Relationship Mapping feature will enable users to discover, visualize, and leverage relationships between files in their system. This document outlines the development approach, milestones, and implementation details for this feature.

## Goals & Objectives

1. **Identify Relationships**: Automatically detect various types of relationships between files
2. **Map Connections**: Create a queryable graph of file relationships
3. **Visualize Relationships**: Provide intuitive visualization of file connections
4. **Search by Relationship**: Enable finding files based on their relationships to other files
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing tag system and search functionality

## Types of Relationships to Detect

1. **Reference Relationships**: Files explicitly referencing each other
   - Import/include statements in code
   - Hyperlinks in documents
   - References to other files in comments or text

2. **Content Relationships**: Files with similar or related content
   - Semantic similarity (using our existing embedding system)
   - Shared topics or entities
   - Code with similar functions or patterns

3. **Structural Relationships**: Files related by structure
   - Parent/child directory structure
   - Project-related files (e.g., source and test files)
   - Files with naming patterns (e.g., `file.py` and `file_test.py`)

4. **Temporal Relationships**: Files related by time
   - Files created or modified in the same timeframe
   - Version history relationships
   - Files accessed together in similar time patterns

5. **Derived Relationships**: Files that are derived from others
   - Generated files and their sources
   - Compiled files and their source code
   - Document formats (e.g., PDF generated from Markdown)

## Component Architecture

### 1. Core Components

- **RelationshipDetector**: Engine for detecting relationships between files
- **RelationshipStore**: Database for storing and querying relationships
- **RelationshipGraph**: Graph-based representation of file relationships
- **RelationshipVisualizer**: Tools for visualizing file relationships

### 2. Detection Strategies

- **ReferenceDetector**: Identifies explicit references between files
- **ContentSimilarityDetector**: Finds files with similar content
- **StructuralDetector**: Identifies files related by structure

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Relationships table
CREATE TABLE relationships (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    source_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    target_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    relationship_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    confidence REAL DEFAULT 1.0,
    metadata TEXT,  -- JSON blob for additional data
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(source_path, target_path, relationship_type)
);

-- Indexes for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX idx_relationships_source ON relationships(source_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_relationships_target ON relationships(target_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_relationships_type ON relationships(relationship_type);
```

### Key Classes

#### RelationshipDetector

```python
class RelationshipDetector:
    """Detects relationships between files using various strategies."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = []
        # Register default strategies

    async def detect_relationships(self, file_path: Path,
                                 context_paths: Optional[List[Path]] = None) -> List[Relationship]:
        """Detect relationships for a file."""
        relationships = []
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            strategy_relationships = await strategy.detect(file_path, context_paths)
            relationships.extend(strategy_relationships)
        return relationships

                         max_depth: int = 2) -> 'Graph':
        """Build a graph starting from root files."""
        # Implementation
